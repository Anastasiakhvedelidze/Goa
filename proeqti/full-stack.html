    <b>What is front-end development?
        Front-end development refers to creating and maintaining the part of the website with which end users interact. That includes the font of the text, the colors of the page and the styles of the menus and links visible on the screen. Front-end developers not only establish the overall look of a site but also create its interface and user experience. In carrying out this directive, they also perform a variety of additional tasks, such as:
        Developing an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface
        Improving the user interface based on user feedback
        Optimizing the user experience, resolving issues of design or functionality that may hinder navigation
        Optimizing a website to function properly across device types and browsers
        Creating concepts and using tools to materialize them
        Helping to organize and manage the software workflow
        Testing a website's front end for ease of use and potential errors
        Applying search engine optimization (SEO) principles to ensure appropriate indexing of the website by search engines 
        The technical skills of front-end developers largely revolve around programming languages like HTML, JavaScript and CSS. These tools are essential for creating the layout of a website and adding various visual elements to improve both functionality and aesthetic quality. Essential soft skills of the role include collaboration and teamwork, as front-end developers typically work closely with others—web designers, user experience ( UX) analysts and back-end developers—to ensure they're meeting specifications.</b>

        <center><h2>Back-end development</h2></center>
        <hr>
        <b>What is back-end development?
            Back-end development refers to the creation and maintenance of a website's internal operations. A website's back end consists of its server, an application and a database, so the primary function of a back-end developer is to ensure those components are running appropriately. Without them, the front end of the site wouldn't be possible. Aside from that major responsibility, the primary duties of the job include:
            Understanding a site's main objectives and determining how to facilitate them
            Ensuring proper storage of data and easy access to it for end users
            Managing application programming interfaces, making sure they work across platforms
            Organizing a website system's logic and optimizing it to run properly on various devices
            Establishing payment systems when necessary, including allowing users to input their data and securing said data per regulations
            Creating website architecture that's easily modifiable with future upgrades
            Implementing algorithms
            Resolving back-end issues as they arise
            Success as a back-end developer hinges on your mastery of the main server-side languages. These include Python, Java and PHP for application building and tools such as Oracle and SQL, which allow you to serve data to the front end. Communication skills are also essential, as back-end development involves working closely with stakeholders to gather requirements and translate them into specifications.</b>

    <br>
    <b>Websites consist of two parts: the front end, which users experience, and the back end, which comprises the invisible structure making the front end possible. The difference between front-end and back-end development can seem confusing, given their similarities in making websites function properly.

        Front-end developers design the visual aspects of websites for users to interact with, including colors, layout, and fonts. Back-end developers create the invisible structure that helps websites function properly. Back-end developers have a different technical skillset and make higher salaries than front-end developers.
        
        Full-stack developers work with all parts of a website and use front-end and back-end coding skills. Keep reading to learn more about front-end vs. back-end development, including key proficiencies required for both focuses.
        
        Front-End Development
        Front-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools. They produce the drop-down menus, layouts, and designs for websites.
        
        Front-end devs use computer programming languages like JavaScript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design websites. Each language serves a unique purpose. HTML lays out the site's content and structure, CSS adds design features, and JavaScript creates advanced interactive features. Less commonly, front-end devs know other programming languages like Python, PHP, or Ruby.
        
        These developers need expertise using frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, and EmberJS. Frameworks ensure that content appears correctly on all devices, while libraries condense code into smaller, time-saving packages. Front-end devs may also use graphic design programs like Photoshop or Sketch, along with code editing tools like Notepad or Eclipse.
        
        Front-end development requires technical expertise and creativity to ensure websites' user interfaces look correct and function properly. Front-end devs work with back-end developers, designers, and user experience analysts.
        
        A front-end developer typically needs a bachelor's degree in web design, programming, computer science, or graphic design. Some individuals develop these skills through previous work, coding bootcamps, or projects to find employment without pursuing formal education.
        
        Below, we describe key front-end developer skills and explain why they need these abilities.</b>
